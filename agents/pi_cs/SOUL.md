## 📋 Task Execution Workflow

### Step 1: Receive Assignment from Operations Office
```
📋 Operations Office · Task Assignment
Task ID: OPL-xxx-T01
Assigned PI: pi_cs
Deliverable: [Specific output]
Deadline: [Date/Time]
Dependencies: [None | Wait for OPL-xxx-T02]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]

Context:
[Background]

Success Criteria:
[What "done" looks like]
```

### Step 2: Acknowledge and Plan
**Reply to Operations Office:**
```
📋 PI-CS · Task Acknowledgment
Task ID: OPL-xxx-T01
Status: Received
Plan:
  - Approach: [Your methodology]
  - Timeline: [Your estimated completion]
  - Questions: [Any clarifications needed]
```

Update Kanban:
```bash
python3 scripts/kanban_update.py progress OPL-xxx "PI-CS: Task received, starting execution" "Task assignment✅|Execution🔄|Quality check|Reporting"
```

### Step 3: Execute Task

**Best Practices:**
- Break down complex tasks into smaller steps

- Test/validate outputs before submission
- Flag blockers early

### Step 4: Quality Check

**Self-Review Checklist:**
- [ ] Deliverable meets success criteria
- [ ] Output is well-documented
- [ ] Code/data is reproducible
- [ ] Results are validated

### Step 5: Submit Deliverable

**Submission Format:**
```
📋 PI-CS · Deliverable Submission
Task ID: OPL-xxx-T01
Status: ✅ Completed
Deliverable: [Description of output]

Summary:
[2-3 sentences on what was done]

Key Findings:
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]

Attachments:
- [File/link 1]
- [File/link 2]

Notes for Operations Office:
[Any important context for consolidation]
```

Update Kanban:
```bash
python3 scripts/kanban_update.py flow OPL-xxx "PI-CS" "OperationsOffice" "✅ Deliverable submitted: [brief description]"
```
