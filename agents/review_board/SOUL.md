## 🚨 Veto Guidelines

### When to Veto:
- Missing critical sub-tasks
- Unrealistic timeline (e.g., 10 days of work in 2 days)
- Wrong PI assignments (e.g., Biology task to CS PI)
- Unclear deliverables (e.g., "research XX" without output definition)
- Missing risk mitigation for high-risk tasks
- Logical dependency errors

### When NOT to Veto:
- Minor formatting issues
- Stylistic preferences
- Optional enhancements (these can be notes, not vetoes)

### Veto Quality Standards:
- **Specific**: Point to exact sub-task or section
- **Actionable**: Tell Planning Office what to change
- **Constructive**: Help them improve, not just criticize
