## 📊 Permission Matrix

### Message Sending Permissions

| From ↓ → To | Lab Director | Planning | Review | Operations | CS | Chem | Bio | Mat | Med | Agr | Env | Eng |
|-------------|--------------|----------|--------|------------|----|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Human User** | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Lab Director** | — | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Planning Office** | ❌ | — | ✅ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Review Board** | ❌ | ✅ (Veto) | — | ✅ (Approve) | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |
| **Operations Office** | ✅ (Report) | ❌ | ❌ | — | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| **PIs** | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (Progress) | — | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ |

---

## 📜 Permission Rules

### Rule 1: Human User Direct Access
**Human User communicates ONLY with Lab Director.**

- ✅ Human User → Lab Director: All task directives
- ❌ Human User → Any other role: Intercepted

**Rationale**: Lab Director is the single point of triage. This prevents:
- Overloading execution agents with casual queries
- Bypassing the planning and review process
- Inconsistent task creation

---

### Rule 2: Single-Direction Flow
**Tasks flow in one direction: Lab Director → Planning → Review → Operations → PIs**

| Transition | Allowed | Notes |
|------------|---------|-------|
| Lab Director → Planning | ✅ | Directive forwarding |
| Planning → Review | ✅ | Plan submission |
| Review → Operations | ✅ | Plan approval |
| Review → Planning | ✅ | Veto (with feedback) |
| Operations → PIs | ✅ | Task assignment |
| PIs → Operations | ✅ | Progress reports |
| Operations → Lab Director | ✅ | Final report |
| Lab Director → Human User | ✅ | Final reply |

**Reverse flows are NOT allowed** (except veto):
- ❌ PIs → Planning (must go through Operations)
- ❌ Planning → Operations (must go through Review)
- ❌ Operations → Review (only Review → Operations)

---

### Rule 3: Review Board Veto Power
**Review Board can veto Planning Office plans.**

| Action | Allowed | Requirements |
|--------|---------|--------------|
| Approve → Operations | ✅ | Plan meets quality standards |
| Veto → Planning | ✅ | Must include specific feedback |
| Veto → Operations | ❌ | Cannot veto after approval |
| Veto → PIs | ❌ | No direct communication |

**Veto Requirements**:
1. Must specify exact issues (not vague criticism)
2. Must provide actionable modification suggestions
3. Must reference specific sub-tasks or sections

---

### Rule 4: No Cross-PI Communication
**PIs communicate ONLY with Operations Office.**

- ✅ PI → Operations: Progress reports, deliverable submissions, blocker notifications
- ❌ PI → PI: Intercepted (must coordinate through Operations)
- ❌ PI → Planning/Review: Intercepted

**Rationale**: Operations Office is the single coordinator. This ensures:
- Centralized progress tracking
- Conflict resolution by designated coordinator
- Consistent consolidation of results

---

### Rule 5: Report Channel
**Only Operations Office reports final results to Lab Director.**

- ✅ Operations → Lab Director: Final consolidated report
- ❌ PIs → Lab Director: Intercepted
- ❌ PIs → Human User: Intercepted

**Rationale**: Lab Director receives unified report, not fragmented PI updates.

---

### Rule 6: Escalation Path
**Issues escalate through designated channels only.**

```
PI → Operations Office → Lab Director → Human User (if critical)
```

| Issue Level | Handler |
|-------------|---------|
| Task blocker | Operations Office |
| Cross-PI conflict | Operations Office |
| Plan quality concern | Review Board |
| Critical project risk | Lab Director → Human User |

---

## 🚨 Violation Handling

### Automatic Interception
The system automatically intercepts permission violations:

```
[INTERCEPTED] Message from pi_cs to pi_chem
Reason: Direct PI-to-PI communication not allowed
Action: Route through Operations Office
```

### Violation Log
All violations are logged for audit:
```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-03-18T15:30:00Z",
  "from": "pi_cs",
  "to": "pi_chem",
  "violation": "Direct PI-to-PI communication",
  "action": "Intercepted and logged"
}
```

### Repeated Violations
- 1st violation: Warning + automatic reroute
- 2nd violation: Warning to role supervisor
- 3rd violation: Escalate to Lab Director

## 📝 Notes

1. **Permission enforcement is automatic** — The system intercepts violations before delivery.
2. **Audit trail is complete** — All messages (allowed and intercepted) are logged.
3. **Exceptions require Lab Director approval** — Emergency communications must be approved by Lab Director.
4. **Matrix is configurable** — Adjust permissions by editing this file and updating system config.
